# Introduction 

This repo provides C++ solvers to Futoshiki Puzzle with 3 different implementation. Namely, [Project1](/Project1/) was implemented with a sequantial logic; [Project2](/Project2/) was improved version of Project1 by introducing parallel computing with the [OpenMP libraries](https://www.openmp.org); in [Project3](/Project3/), the solver was further improved by GPU parallelization with [CUDA libraries](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda-libraries/index.html). 

At every project folder, there is a PDF file that explains the implementation and runtime metrics of the algorithm. In addition, the project task PDF and input txt can be found in the folders.
